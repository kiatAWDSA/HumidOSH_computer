# HumidOSH_computer
The HumidOSH is a self-contained environmental chamber with controls for relative humidity and fan speed. This repository contains
the source code for the optional computer program that is used to record readings from the HumidOSH. The full repository containing
bill of materials and other components of the system can be found at https://osf.io/wckhm/.

## Installation
If you only need the computer program, you can download it from https://osf.io/dgmqs/ by following the instructions on the Wiki in
that page. If you want to view or modify the source code, click the green "Clone or download button" on this page (it's at the
top right of the big list of files) and click "Download ZIP." Extract the files somewhere on your computer.

If you are looking for the Arduino program that is uploaded to the Arduino Nano in the control box of a HumidOSH unit, please visit
